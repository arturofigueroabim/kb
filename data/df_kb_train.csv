we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education,0
a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success,0
"through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students",0
"What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others",1
"During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred",1
All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life,1
competition makes the society more effective,0
the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory,1
"when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation",1
"Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care",1
"without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition",0
they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values,0
sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society,0
maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments,1
sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential,0
"Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues",1
"Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values",1
"These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more",1
it is crucial to keep one’s identity,1
they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin,1
keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important,0
children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends,1
"In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home",1
"Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism",1
there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures,0
it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations,0
international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries,0
tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country,0
international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists,1
"Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores",1
These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard,1
"through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected",1
tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes,0
"in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry",1
"Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works",1
newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence,0
the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information,0
"to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers",1
"Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime",1
"As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages",1
"the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time",0
"from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one",1
the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries,1
"The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so",1
newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive,0
"when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down",1
This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today,1
a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both,0
a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities,0
both are crucial on the way to a brighter future,0
"if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education",0
"a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development",1
"elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society",1
government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it,1
government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide,0
Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money,1
"for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance",1
The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community,1
Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention,1
this argument is invalid,1
"Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality",0
the most important quality of roommates is being considered,0
communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate,0
Consideration is always important in relationship,1
roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time,1
Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine,1
"At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously",1
having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life,0
It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member,1
communication is as well making a good roommate,1
"Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others",1
communication is very important,0
"People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning",1
One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project,1
If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk,1
it would clear up the misinterpretation,1
"governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment",0
they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air,0
Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society,1
the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth,0
"if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released",1
carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere,1
"the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged",1
"If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work",1
"This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment",0
there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads,1
It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities,1
governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes,0
There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion,1
the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam,1
high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around,0
public transportation systems even have more important advantages,0
They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere,0
the physical education part should not be outweighed,0
"Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country",0
"the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students",0
"if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation",0
healthy body is basis for healthy soul,1
There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises,1
"The more we practice, the better we feel",1
"there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better",1
"when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer",0
"when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation",1
the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically,1
"almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education",1
financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is,0
the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare,1
the nation is comparatively healthy,1
physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development,1
"the better a person feels, the better his brain works",1
putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society,0
it ends up with financially competitive country,1
email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology,0
"Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered",1
"nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not",1
Another important aspect on technology is transferring money,1
"Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before",1
"with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily",0
technology has helped us to have more comfortable life,0
"You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth",0
"Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online",1
"But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily",1
"In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement",1
one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries,1
Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world,1
Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments,0
technology makes children even more creative,0
technology may have some negative effects on children,0
technology may have negative effects on children,0
Technology has made life too easy for most children,1
"In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change",1
technology inspires children to create new things,1
technology widen children's knowledge,1
"when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works",1
Children are curious about everything around them,1
"Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked",1
"After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer",1
"In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight",1
"instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create",0
"In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective",1
they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking,1
"with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends",1
Knowledge is the base of creativity,1
"The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things",0
They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age,0
"with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products",1
students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers,0
"teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten",1
"And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers",1
It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling,1
students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers,1
students learn far more from their teachers than from other source,0
teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong,0
"They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it",1
students learn things easily,1
they contend that good television programs do teach students,1
Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes,1
"Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc",1
"students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television",0
within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes,1
they may be factors decreasing the position of written language,0
"it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity",0
we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity,0
"Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones",1
"Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information",1
People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want,1
"thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time",1
They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways,1
email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above,1
"The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position",0
People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities,1
language in writing is not in its original form,1
"people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts",1
"it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments",1
"If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand",1
there is some disadvantages of animals' profits,0
the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits,0
it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals,0
doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation,0
animals are friendly and vital for people,1
"if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well",1
The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals,1
animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance,1
it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life,1
"it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying",0
The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life,1
even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines,1
it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing,1
television devastate families ties,0
most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television,0
it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution,0
"killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive",0
"In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task",0
Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising,1
We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities,1
This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday,1
there is no time for call to our parents or friends,1
watching television programs makes us lazy,0
We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office,1
we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports,1
This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable,1
some television programs have a negative effect on viewers,0
Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity,1
These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers,1
They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors,1
universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject,0
we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal,0
Our youth has become very confident towards his career,1
They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations,1
Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer,1
Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders,0
women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor,1
nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky,1
They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also,1
university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination,1
They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission,1
universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender,0
the current job market affects the decision of universities,1
Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers,1
The job selection criteria are pre decided,1
employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine,1
They prefer male staff for night shifts,1
"They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc",1
for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents,0
"their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home",0
They will have to pay a lot of bills,1
"they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like",1
They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate,0
Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money,0
"If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal",1
If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working,1
they will not have money to pay for everything,1
There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home,1
parents will take care for them,1
parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying,1
"Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like",0
"His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses",1
Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults,1
"When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice",1
"they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other",1
more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution,0
both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution,0
governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution,0
"If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause",0
"in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions",1
The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution,1
"While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution",1
"by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution",0
private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating,1
"As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes",1
some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution,1
governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies,0
"Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals",0
the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges,0
higher education does not guarantee young students' success,0
"it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming",0
"there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers",1
labors for graduates are in short supply,1
the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying,1
"universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine",0
These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world,1
many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society,1
diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently,1
"there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships",1
I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones,0
The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible,0
it has a number of problems that should be well handled,0
almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems,0
"Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive",1
some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other,1
"it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented",1
some harmful effects on our health are lethal,0
"It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed",1
There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party,0
This possibility exists all the time,1
a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users,1
the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life,0
"Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth",1
"it still has its bad side, especially for children",0
it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life,0
using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes,0
"When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted",1
children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills,1
"people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences",0
"several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression",1
"a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days",1
even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much,0
"Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead",1
they will have a bad result in school,1
"when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying",1
they will know little about the outside life,1
"the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories",0
a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate,0
"To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit",1
"the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area",1
the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need,1
"It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems",1
"in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances",1
The main disadvantage is contamination,0
how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it,0
it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society,1
most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well,1
"it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits",0
it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society,0
easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health,0
"to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people",1
ingredients being added have caused dire consequences,1
there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases,1
Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition,0
"Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up",1
the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work,0
it is not a good thing,0
The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose,0
"At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes",1
"rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking",1
financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries,0
it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation,0
the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid,1
education is an essential part in development,1
"most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities",1
"if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support",0
developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries,0
some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market,1
they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas,1
it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries,0
Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers,0
modern society needs advertising,0
Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services,0
advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way,0
"advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited",0
these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children,1
Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis,1
"some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries",1
"by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services",0
"Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us",1
"These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising",0
tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy,1
"In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers",1
Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country,1
married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly,0
Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household,0
it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money,0
married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home,0
a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long,0
extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses,1
"By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life",1
This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present,1
it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better,0
"working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity",1
"These things in turn will make them more confident, independent",1
These women will set a good example for their children,1
there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work,0
"Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women",1
this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives,0
they need to make some contribution too for their children future,1
government should not pay for the university fees,0
this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them,0
"government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees",0
Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees,0
I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education,0
It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education,1
students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it,1
They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves,0
the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well,1
alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced,0
alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion,0
some people claim the convenience of automobile,0
it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles,0
an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution,1
automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air,1
the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants,1
the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented,0
an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion,1
"Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while",1
"traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents",1
alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal,1
rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries,1
"This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee",1
bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses,1
it is a better form to protect environment than automobile,1
alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively,0
these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution,1
the introduction of international laws can be also effective,1
there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only,1
"aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons",0
"being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live",0
"there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy",0
just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries,0
a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries,0
Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business,0
poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer,1
"To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies",1
republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's,1
Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties,1
aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people,0
"If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted",1
"It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization",1
the campaigns might include practical benefits,0
"In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others",1
"When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt",1
I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress,0
the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments,1
Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country,0
globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects,0
"Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world",1
they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries,1
globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension,0
convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization,1
student have to be forced to study at school,0
students should study at school,0
there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job,0
studying at school is always the best choice for children's future,1
There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job,1
they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future,0
employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills,1
schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying,1
schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students,1
"Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences",1
It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things,1
children should interrupt their school work and get a job,0
Whether children can learn a lot at school,1
there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future,1
children can learn social skills when they have a job,1
They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school,1
Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned,1
these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television,0
"The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers",0
it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product,0
"To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising",1
huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product,1
"By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly",1
"youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities",1
having these products shows their status,1
the quality obviously is not relatively important,1
it plays and important role economically,0
they aim to grab your attention,1
"They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable",1
advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated,1
"Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition",1
"Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective",1
it is sensible to enforce the gun control,0
the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence,0
"considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates",0
"most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people",0
guns will create a violent society if the trend continues,1
"in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting",1
"some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger",1
"the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates",0
The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns,1
we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting,1
the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide,0
"In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent",1
there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over,1
international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way,0
It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way,0
International sporting events will draw the international concern,0
It really help to alleviate the tension,0
it is useful to ease tensions between nations,1
People can understand more about a country,1
An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world,1
"For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together",1
"in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking",1
The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action,1
due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism,1
It is rare times when people can learn about this country,1
an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way,0
"When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions",1
"Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport",1
all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media,1
They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people,1
"In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country",1
foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students,1
"They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities",1
Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world,1
the good technology bringing to us is undeniable,0
"Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it",0
"most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people",0
the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products,1
"About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one",1
"Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies",1
the Internet gives everyone access to the same information,1
this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals,1
"With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day",1
"technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life",0
we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us,1
"we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us",1
the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology,0
"only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return",1
"it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap",1
human beings should travel to outer space,0
there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space,0
many facts about solar system can be discovered,0
"a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat",1
"it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa",1
"If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts",1
people can know more about the planet earth itself,0
"By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth",1
"With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming",1
a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented,0
"As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks",1
"Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater",1
"spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society",1
having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits,0
"By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation",0
It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs,1
having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation,0
students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience,1
that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities,1
Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities,1
students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones,0
"By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained",1
"working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities",1
doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation,0
"high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students",1
"With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved",1
that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life,0
students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to,0
students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation,1
"In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom",1
"the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy",1
"As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money",1
companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation,0
they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training,1
"the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan",1
students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say,0
"large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation",0
"it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness",0
world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace,0
"during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event",1
"when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers",1
"international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality",1
it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events,0
these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country,1
"when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field",1
South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night,1
This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team,1
This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future,0
it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy,0
This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming,0
it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources,0
the major source of energy today is water,1
there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source,1
To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short,1
during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India,1
"If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity",1
the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming,0
the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming,1
the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution,1
"it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out",0
the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people,0
direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity,0
Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only,0
Tax revenue is collected from those who works,1
Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers,1
"there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education",1
addressing unemployment should have low priority,1
"to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well",0
"If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all",1
it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again,1
this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance,0
They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support,1
"the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work",1
"A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge",0
"students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers",1
"High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field",1
students are the ones here to seek knowledge,1
the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources,0
"a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste",0
universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather,1
"It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed",1
wild animals should be set free from zoos,0
animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos,0
it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in,0
it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings,1
Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals,1
zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives,0
the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression,1
"if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures",1
the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss,1
"zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside",0
the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting,1
the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat,1
the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide,1
they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression,0
online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions,0
distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases,0
educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios,0
distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world,0
"In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation",1
"Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide",1
the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students,1
"Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains",1
attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates,0
They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life,1
It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive,1
there are valid arguments to the contrary,0
the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication,0
modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases,0
these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind,0
mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business,1
"With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds",1
it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world,1
"With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine",1
people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies,0
the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits,1
the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money,1
Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services,1
An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory,0
music can help an individual to shape its character,0
many university authorities provide music lessons for their students,0
they live and study in a harmony with music,1
It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology,1
"students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time",1
music can be a useful and interesting solution,1
"if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life",1
students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music,1
the calm atmosphere in the class might be created,1
it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students,1
music and other entertaining subjects should be optional,0
"Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace",1
"students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song",1
"students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously",1
music is the art which requires special attitude towards it,1
"demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees",1
universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else,0
libraries are more important,0
They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library,0
a library is vital and strategical part of a university,1
All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library,0
"after internet, library plays an important role in research",1
sport is important,1
it does not have the same priority of library has,0
only small part of students attend sport activities,1
in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities,1
universities support is vital for libraries,1
Most libraries are free not for students also for public,1
usually libraries do not have income,1
"there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income",0
sport activities have a good income,1
every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors,1
they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets,1
investing in libraries has a long-time result,0
a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers,1
Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time,1
"in the far future, they become more valuable",1
most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time,1
human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters,0
Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior,0
"Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them",0
"Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation",1
"Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples",1
They are kept for security purposes in houses,1
many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits,0
"cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation",1
"This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle",1
thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products,0
Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights,1
"Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster",1
And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals,1
some museums and art galleries will not disappear,0
museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture,0
modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions,0
technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time,1
"people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society",0
"in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy",1
they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication,1
the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture,0
these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture,0
museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages,1
authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos,1
"It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it",1
I do support the view of learning all school subjects,0
"concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future",0
The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized,0
"with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future",1
Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate,1
"In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes",1
"still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done",1
most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs,1
this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness,0
students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects,1
"under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study",1
the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study,1
it's a reasonable loss in globalization,0
I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around,0
No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally,0
communication between countries and cultures become convenient,1
"In my country, English is a required course from elementary school",1
studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters,1
"language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country",1
enhances relationship and promotes international business,1
"researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English",1
"Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English",1
"It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides",1
they have no choice but choosing English as a second language,1
the culture heritage and nation identity vanish,0
English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year,1
"this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society",1
creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions,0
Creativity originates in a free mind,0
artists should be given the freedom of expression,0
Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message,0
"Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message",1
"Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras",1
innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience,0
It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments,1
"Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue",1
This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds,1
creativity also gives aesthetic charm,1
"Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely",0
"Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“",1
Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains,1
Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries,0
Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws,0
"Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose",0
artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people,1
Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people,1
children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition,0
Co-operation is essential for teamwork,0
Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children,1
We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success,1
A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself,1
lions hunt in a team,1
It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy,1
"co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate",1
co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes,0
It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others,1
A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements,1
competition is also as important as co-operation,1
Competition helps in improvement and evolution,0
"An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others",1
Competition has helped the development of science and technology,1
"every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others",1
This kind of competition gives customers more options,1
Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule,0
blind and selfish competition is detrimental,1
"'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run",1
A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach,1
"strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society",0
Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society,0
"psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment",0
Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner,0
capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals,0
"When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment",1
"Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases",1
Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings,1
the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased,0
capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes,1
"When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes",1
capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals,1
"Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment",0
"They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals",0
the jury giving the verdict are also humans,1
They have the life of a person at their discretion,1
"The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime",1
"if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous",1
"Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment",1
a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school,0
a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies,0
the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them,0
"a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies",0
"when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge",1
A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change,1
"A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions",1
"Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest",0
It will also help them to learn professional setup by working,1
"Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job",1
Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course,1
A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental,0
Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time,1
"When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia",1
my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted,1
"When he started his university studies, he failed miserably",1
A break gives students more benefits than harms,1
"It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period",1
"Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices",0
both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers,0
Equality in education will help in development of the society,0
Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior,1
females should be given equal opportunities as males,0
The whole world aims for women empowerment,1
"Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females",1
"When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop",1
"Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run",0
Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other,1
It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together,1
students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them,1
females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys,1
Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both,1
"some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc",0
This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society,1
women have proved their mettle in every field,1
"Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills",1
people are likely to spend less time in cooking food,0
people will spend less time in cooking food,0
it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future,0
"people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years",1
"with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time",1
"in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework",1
And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology,1
they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal,1
"89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on",1
most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants,0
"Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study",1
"it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time",1
investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family,0
"as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality",1
health and life of eaters is assured,1
"Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed",1
"along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities",1
they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves,1
parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games,0
"traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games",0
Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process,0
"modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend",0
"children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future",1
"children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative",1
"traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society",0
One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills,1
"Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face",1
communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more,1
it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today,0
these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices,1
modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits,1
"there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival",1
government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities,0
budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities,0
"the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens",0
providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government,0
Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums,1
"an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games",1
"Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented",0
"Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience",1
"The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government",1
"the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government",1
it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs,1
sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support,0
they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis,1
putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them,1
not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot,1
technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles,0
"In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life",0
"with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere",1
"In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles",1
This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills,1
"technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing",0
"China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens",1
many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture,1
some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles,0
"especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques",1
people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years,1
technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles,0
freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create,0
they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas,0
this world needs them to make itself colourful,0
One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society,0
the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work,1
"art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning",1
"If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value",1
the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified,1
restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply,0
"some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc",1
adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents,1
"in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art",1
"This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society",0
"Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on",0
"the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields",1
Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children,1
the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society,1
the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well,0
"The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money",1
in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles,0
women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration,1
such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate,0
women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives,1
children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work,1
it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems,0
addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate,0
whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated,1
"price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area",1
it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly,0
governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands,1
"pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution",1
"the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours",1
several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems,0
"authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars",1
"temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season",1
with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems,1
"cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice",1
"I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication",0
"both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words",0
it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many,0
pictures can influence the way people think,0
nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking,1
"statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit",1
"the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan",1
"images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements",1
written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages,0
"With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images",1
this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about,1
the primary way of educating students is also by this way,1
Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better,1
all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible,0
"it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country",1
Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting,0
It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country,1
"The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist",1
it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more,1
there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages,0
"governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results",1
"there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those",1
These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular,1
"the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre",1
"If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money",1
government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs,0
governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs,0
art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives,0
those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life,0
"Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is",0
"In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens",1
knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system,1
"art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives",0
it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work,1
"it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room",1
"By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all",1
"the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help",0
"such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry",1
"If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk",1
the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable,0
"without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security",1
it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens,1
"citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society",1
it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society,0
"a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately",1
"the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address",1
flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation,0
thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously,0
"unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources",1
people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems,1
the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting,0
"some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments",1
they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards,1
"these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience",1
the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment,0
"With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales",1
electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years,1
it may spur its economic development,1
"If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity",1
taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies,0
"without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development",1
arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well,0
the government should give priority to public services and facilities,1
public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability,0
"the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable",1
"public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate",1
arts should by no means been disregarded by the government,0
arts can enrich people's cultural lives,1
"Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition",1
"they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure",1
"Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems",1
public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure,0
the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous,0
funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development,0
Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts,1
"preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry",1
arts serve cultural and economic purposes,1
more good come from zoos than bad,0
both of the arguments have strong supports,0
keeping animals in captivity is wrong,0
animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom,1
This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures,1
"many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require",1
The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment,1
sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe,1
zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology,0
"Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world",1
Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public,1
zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life,1
"in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters",1
zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced,1
the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece,0
there should not be any restrictions on artists' work,0
there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas,0
there should be no restrictions on them,0
Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves,1
ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations,1
even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects,1
"without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists",0
"if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run",1
"when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies",1
paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times,1
it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation,1
human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely,0
"Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries",1
Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country,1
the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn,1
"In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society",0
artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts,1
They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country,1
Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace,1
I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power,0
nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages,0
pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons,0
Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons,1
If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage,1
even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity,0
recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area,1
This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable,1
Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it,0
while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power,1
This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material,1
giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money,0
providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment,0
"when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities",1
"if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive",0
they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them,1
"With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job",1
the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with,1
supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money,1
the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed,0
the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country,1
the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living,1
"when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity",0
"It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless",1
Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones,1
the public's money is spent worthlessly,1
"till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment",0
CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace,0
CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise,0
This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers,0
privacies are lost with the use of these cameras,1
safety should be put first in order to be safe,1
CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized,0
"by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down",1
"when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced",1
"in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight",1
"as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops",1
the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation,1
these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers,0
the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded,1
"at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers",1
face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger,1
Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras,0
one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences,1
opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime,1
the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken,1
"I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business",0
working for the other have some advantages,0
people that have their own business are more comfortable,0
"They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities",0
there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others,0
"In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss",1
"You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it",1
"when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager",0
"nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair",1
there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others,0
When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want,1
"Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation",1
"For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed",1
a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal,0
people should not give up when they face with a failure,0
"they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced",0
"when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes",0
"most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems",1
"experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile",0
"scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final",1
human needs should be considered more,0
endangered animals are important,0
day by day population is increasing,1
human needs for food is increasing as well,1
"nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry",0
increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals,0
they do not need so much land that people need,0
the population of endangered animals are less than people's population,1
farmlands are vital for human life,0
"We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks",1
people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals,1
Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable,1
they need land to build their houses on it,0
some lands should be assigned to industry,0
"human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine",1
Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry,1
although appearance is important,0
personality is the most important,0
We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance,0
the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance,0
we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance,0
there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing,1
"some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality",1
"One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home",1
"I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her",1
"She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable",1
"there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague",0
I had to never judge with people's appearance,1
fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles,0
"people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes",0
"creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like",0
"following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today",0
"When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world",1
"if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds",1
they might fall behind shortly,1
people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information,1
"Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles",0
following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities,1
"Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes",1
the world would look monotonous,0
"as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor",0
"wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways",0
Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run,0
"it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so",0
"Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals",1
such aid could also create a win-win situation,0
Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds,1
"For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations",1
"related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry",1
"The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning",1
"By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce",1
"The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy",1
It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment,0
we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment,0
reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services,0
Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations,0
Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens,1
"thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences",1
"if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older",1
health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases,1
"Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes",1
Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment,1
Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly,1
"vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on",1
"When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably",1
human resources play a key role in the development of a country,1
investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision,0
the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention,1
the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget,1
"news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge",0
the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people,0
the progress of news media is an advantageous development,0
It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news,1
It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information,1
It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects,1
today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before,1
"The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody",1
the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings,0
"People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match",1
This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work,1
news media help people broaden their knowledge,0
there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better,1
"It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth",1
This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society,1
the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide,1
the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion,0
the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with,0
they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted,0
it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal,0
knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment,1
take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty,1
The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person,1
punishment can be given in accordance to the condition,1
exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision,1
the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences,1
the convicted will also receive a fair action,0
juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law,1
a fair trial can be achieved,1
"when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized",0
"If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public",1
the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well,1
I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education,0
"Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working",0
They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature,1
"Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way",0
It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent,1
Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies,1
This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life,1
They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses,1
They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment,1
There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education,1
"Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries",1
"This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification",1
"Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence",1
Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts,0
one can also shine without even having to attend universities,0
it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions,0
it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper,0
"it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer",0
"Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers",1
"Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners",1
This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals,1
there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university,0
Take for instance those who start their own business,1
These people depend solely on hard work and luck,1
for some of them it proved to be a profitable job,1
Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19,1
he started his computer company in his college dorm room,1
he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now,1
people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life,1
individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful,0
This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports,1
The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph,1
David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many,1
the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old,0
strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age,0
"if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates",1
most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for,0
"a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available",1
"due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace",1
"it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones",0
not all elderly workers are physically well,1
"Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses",1
the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him,1
they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing,1
"the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution",1
it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement,0
the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated,0
"Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation",1
it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge,1
public museums and art galleries will still be necessary,0
we can see the art works and historical objects online,0
the Internet really brings them convenience,1
pictures online are only limited to a screen size,1
the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling,1
we still need museums and art galleries,0
computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects,0
"only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique",1
Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work,0
We can browse the art work from all over the world at home,1
people may not get a spiritual experience,1
"In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing",0
"at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus",1
"at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music",1
"While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience",1
Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes,0
you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist,1
not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen,1
Some details might be dim,1
the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough,1
These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects,1
"I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities",0
The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity,0
"If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better",1
more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines,1
The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs,1
"With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses",1
there are other measures to improve the situation,0
It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes,1
charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free,1
"the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness",0
"the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money",1
these products prove to ensure human health completely,1
"the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation",0
"Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure",1
the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation,0
the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run,0
the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented,0
it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time,1
Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking,1
A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases,1
the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender,0
This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole,1
"the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street",1
"This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness",1
concerns to save Earth are vital,0
rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world,0
Earth is our home and it should be protected,0
The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life,1
life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas,1
wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth,1
large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer,0
Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays,1
excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers,1
either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth,0
a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent,1
Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers,1
the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information,0
it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures,0
One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content,0
They have a serious impact on people in their puberty,1
"an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off",1
television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture,0
A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser,1
This is actually very environmentally unfriendly,1
"the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases",0
"Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths",1
another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest,1
"being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes",0
People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society,0
they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen,0
"If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy",1
Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries,1
"the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace",1
individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax,0
"in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government",1
being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history,1
people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books,1
a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation,1
"if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other",1
primates should have the same rights as human beings,0
it should be made illegal,0
it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result,0
There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned,0
the costs outweigh the benefits,1
"Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result",1
Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money,1
"they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances",1
sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity,0
animals are kept in unnatural conditions,1
"Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs",1
"In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head",1
animals and people's response to a drug can be different,1
human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual,0
"it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading",1
exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement,0
exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system,0
There are clearly advantages to exams,0
They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates,1
"They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability",1
exams also have some drawbacks,0
Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills,1
some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety,1
"teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all",1
A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns,0
exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment,1
Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills,1
"Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability",1
"richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade",0
Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland,0
Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries,0
richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals,0
"in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations",1
High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident,1
poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients,1
richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries,0
"for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students",0
"in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions",1
education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it,1
"in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money",0
Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure,1
residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production,1
richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading,1
The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading,1
"I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers",0
there can be no school without a teacher,0
"computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place",0
"Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs",0
computers need to be operated by people,0
they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch,1
scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching,1
lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector,1
No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today,1
children need human interactions,0
"As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper educatio",1
"Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'",1
"only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model",1
"No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils",1
newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers,0
the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked,0
applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit,1
"artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest",1
the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased,0
high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being,0
"Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently",1
consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future,1
excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society,0
One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission,1
manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages,1
mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry,1
high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields,1
governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work,0
art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere,0
art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists,1
"monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists",1
some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue,1
the governments should help arts,0
their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry,1
culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art,0
sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation,1
Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts,1
talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted,0
not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts,1
this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature,1
"their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields",0
professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions,0
they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own,1
hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship,1
"They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves",1
"there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately",1
"Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts",1
athletes and singers deserve their current salary,0
"singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society",1
It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms,1
"While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life",1
They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience,1
"their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary",1
"their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities",0
"""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept",0
it is absurd and inhumane,0
capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community,0
every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life,0
"what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive",1
they are humans and their lives need to be valued,1
execution does not resolve the consequences of crime,1
it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled,1
"capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives",0
"in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away",1
The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted,0
"many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system",1
"Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion",1
it can be replaced by a life sentence,0
I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit,0
With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit,0
"if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants",0
As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances,1
"if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices",1
they might hit consumer's life,0
"a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die",1
"all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit",0
They can hit both the environment and human's life easily,0
new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community,0
The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community,0
"The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education",0
The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate,0
the new high school will be a great addition for my environment,0
it isn't a big deal,1
"this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying",0
the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education,0
"Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities",1
the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition,1
the students can't study well during the classes,1
They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school,1
the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city,0
"After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions",1
during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch,1
This will increase the social connections of the students,1
The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions,1
The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed,1
this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions,1
teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages,0
they are the best advisor for their children,0
parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children,1
if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things,1
They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life,1
"they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way",1
parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers,0
unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money,1
They cheat young ages,1
they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily,1
it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice,0
childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas,0
the best phase of people life is their childhood,0
"They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them",0
"children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare",1
they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs,1
there is no argument and punishment for them,0
they do not have to educate and they do not have to work,1
they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life,0
"I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten",1
I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age,1
in this age they are not expected to be responsible,0
"the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences",0
everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best,0
"in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers",1
people are able to strengthen their knowledge,1
"through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect",1
they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying,0
"for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding",1
"The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied",1
"students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world",0
"my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc",1
"And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university",1
preparing for career is an essential function of university,0
"Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job",1
they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are,1
they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives,1
life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons,0
People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology,0
"some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority",0
life is simple in the past,1
lives in the old days is easier than today,0
"Nowadays, all humans compete together",1
world population getting higher,1
competition is getting fierce,1
"If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away",1
People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition,1
the environment today is serious damaged,1
"Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings",1
"Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space",1
it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases,1
the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today,0
"Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes",1
it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life,1
The third reason is that the pace of life,0
"If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation",1
We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace,1
"high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude",0
students should have a right to choose what they want to study,0
Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights,1
As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams,1
students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades,1
we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students,1
when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other,1
Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit,0
When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education,1
this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses,0
he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude,1
I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement,0
it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well,0
"through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas",0
the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages,0
"it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks",0
The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region,0
"This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry",1
"The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs",1
"tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry",1
This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes,1
"this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return",1
"Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism",0
"compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers",1
"paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution",1
"the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated",1
It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so,1
this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society,0
it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways,0
not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind,0
There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts,1
the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society,0
"No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration",1
"Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways",1
investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally,0
The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions,1
governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way,0
"no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication",1
these could only help individuals with their physical requirements,1
people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves,0
people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition,0
"with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall",1
This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers,1
A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family,1
The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs,0
corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors,1
many people's jobs are now at high stake,1
"robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies",1
"North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one",1
the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment,1
"computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device",0
"in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life",0
people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it,0
"This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use",1
they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working,1
A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to,1
the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected,1
this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people,0
"This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer",1
Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country,1
using computer can make people easier to complete their work,0
"Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues",1
qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs,0
the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others,0
qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer,0
It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job,1
people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience,1
Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery,1
organization have been transformed to customers oriented,1
Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction,1
the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers,0
people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently,1
"Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise",1
Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way,1
international aid should be prioritised,0
people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary,0
International aid is critical,0
"Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards",1
"They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs",1
"What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members",1
those people are in desperate need of international support,1
there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected,1
charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country,1
"even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs",1
"By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth",1
it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens,0
people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems,1
"they are important somehow, but not essential",0
These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs,0
"an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while",0
"if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different",1
these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs,0
"After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority",1
"recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea",1
world sport events provide positive waves for number of people,0
The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team,1
"These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too",1
these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased,1
the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun,1
students can acquire more benefits from the remote education,0
traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future,0
"distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose",0
studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense,0
"Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection",1
This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line,1
he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course,1
A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule,1
long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches,0
"Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc",1
"traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations",0
These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities,1
"with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts",1
there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses,0
judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular,0
both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education,1
"In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations",1
"female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females",0
"due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure",1
"Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector",1
"every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender",0
I agree that face-to-face communication is better,0
I prefer to express my opinion in person,0
the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite,0
the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face,0
communicating in person can be more convincing,1
"Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle",1
He once complained a service of a restaurant,1
"Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it",1
"Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication",1
"If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important",1
we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way,0
it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication,1
"I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric",1
He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore,1
I just shocked and did not know what happened,1
I realized that his facebook account was stolen,1
we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face,0
"communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication",0
"It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words",1
"Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us",1
successful people still do things they already know,0
doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed,0
the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite,0
"to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter",1
"The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own",1
Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment,1
"He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income",1
He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time,1
successful people do not have to try new things or take risks,0
it is not necessary for successful people to take risks,0
it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not,1
a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success,1
the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills,1
The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm,1
those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed,1
doing something new is necessary for people to success,0
"they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success",1
Try something new can indeed make people become special,1
while it does not mean successful,1
"it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners",0
"everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students",0
"This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most",0
focusing only on talented students is a better option,0
it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality,1
"Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge",1
"some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones",1
"That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions",1
they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone,1
university should only accept good students,0
it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes,1
"this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs'",1
it gives no harm to the whole community,1
"Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions",1
limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice,1
"it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves",1
this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society,1
I prefer to spend money on improving facilities,0
improving facilities is the best way for school,0
the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other,0
students can procure more advantages from better facilities,0
"the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge",1
certain facilities are beneficial to students,0
library is a good place for students to study or research,1
"They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize",1
"With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition",1
students are not always staying in classrooms,1
students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities,0
They have numerous activities in school,1
Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school,1
He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance,1
"With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind",1
schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers,0
they can impart their students well,1
A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study,1
It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards,1
students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics,0
tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university,0
it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles,0
students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education,0
students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested,0
"They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject",1
a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field,1
students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields,1
General education plays a significant role in specialized education,1
"Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics",1
"textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects",1
you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry,1
high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university,0
schools should be responsible for their future and protect them,0
students have tendency to shun difficulties,1
"They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much",1
This might result in limited choices in the future,1
games are no longer too important for them,0
"adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable",0
"Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children",0
games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin,0
Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life,1
"more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies",1
they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago,1
"in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job",1
They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives,1
"adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning",0
"For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not",1
"my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt",1
adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately,1
a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues,1
"they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities",1
a single modern culture is being created by modern technology,0
"new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures",0
"new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world",0
most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology,0
"Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint",1
"students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students",1
many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries,1
jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries,1
new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world,0
"Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field",1
"there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them",0
"many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures",1
cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet,1
"two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad",1
reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies,0
reading fictions is more pleasant,0
"these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners",0
fiction books pay more attention to details,0
"we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it",1
"Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening",1
"after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people",1
a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters,1
reading a novel is more convenient,0
Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour,1
Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains,1
I have started to read a novel since last week,1
"I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class",1
I cannot watch a complete movie,1
"I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study",1
people enjoy watching TV,0
they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies,1
movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners,1
characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners,1
For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable,1
using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live,0
change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one,0
Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page,0
A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way,0
"Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips",1
communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places,1
students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress,1
they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment,1
Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people,1
"exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier",1
few people are worried about the dying local languages,0
These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures,1
They represent local culture,1
"As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly",1
these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost,1
the people from older generation may claim they had better life,0
there were stronger bonds between family members and friends,1
in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically,0
they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice,1
"We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place",0
A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones,1
The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts,1
"social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago",1
some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication,1
"The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in",1
even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists,1
The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives,1
"scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough",1
the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine,0
higher school students should be made aware of the money management,0
students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact,0
"when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence",1
"while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses",1
teenage students need to understand the money management basics,0
"if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized",1
buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background,1
for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour,1
having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently,0
"smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants",0
it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably,0
Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals,0
restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals,1
They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them,1
Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children,0
restaurants are places that people usually come with their families,1
"there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants",1
Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do,1
they have really high curiosity towards something,1
"Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs",0
The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women,1
they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies,1
it is unfair for passive smokers,0
they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one,1
passive smokers will have a lot of health risks,1
"When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke",1
"Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers",1
smoking should not be permitted in restaurants,0
there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged,0
"violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study",0
"growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors",0
unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors,0
"In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him",1
Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles,1
Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs,1
children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best,1
"if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child",0
killing is worse,1
dying is always a disappointing happening,1
"human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters",1
the study of a youngster would affected terribly,0
it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly,1
he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it,1
he has to study for the exam,1
a child watches a frightening movie,1
the study of youngsters shall always been controlled,1
information is power,0
by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability,0
"Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information",1
"Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia",1
"After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia",1
"it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence",0
you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts,0
It is possible to make a wrong decision,1
"you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong",1
"several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops",1
"The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over",1
"it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations",1
it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate,1
all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved,0
we should restore those building,0
old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them,0
governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings,0
the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values,1
"As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing",1
Old buildings are an essential part of history,1
Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings,1
managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation,0
the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them,1
Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there,0
"Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work",0
the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development,0
the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character,0
many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones,0
"Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities",1
internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works,1
"In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone",1
I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends,1
That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester,1
juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic,0
They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand,1
they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want,1
most of these juveniles are students,1
"An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents",1
these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost,1
I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors,0
it is good for health and keep my body fit,0
outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty,0
doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health,0
"last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball",1
Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing,1
"Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games",1
practicing these sports helped me greatly,1
"playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed",1
"After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better",1
Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people,0
"When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl",1
My mother took me to The National Camp,1
"At first, I just ate and played alone",1
"But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively",1
"On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends",1
"Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp",1
"If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today",1
"you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking",0
"If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature",1
"Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings",0
indoor activities are fun,0
"There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy",1
this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities,1
I can also have fun in indoor activities,0
I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time,0
cheap flight can make many serious problem,0
"cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group",0
"These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure",1
"They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds",1
"travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries",1
growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment,0
more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it,1
the biggest concern is the effect on global warming,1
Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up,1
"while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines",1
the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits,0

going to classes should be optional for students,0
sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room,0
Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand,1
I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university,1
She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast,1
she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic,1
she got very good grade when she was graduation,1
they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well,0
many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes,1
I had already studied all biology topics before attending university,1
I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry,1
attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore,0
the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time,0
I would prefer to live in a city,0
I am eager to get a good job and explore different places,0
a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town,0
Big city life provides many opportunities,1
it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city,1
Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply,1
"There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends",1
Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines,1
"I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it",1
"At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis",0
Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one,0
A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people,1
"There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone",1
"I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts",1
"On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art",1
cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside,0
"This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help",1
while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air,0
big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places,0
I would choose to live in a big city,0
computers brought convenience and easiness to our life,0
they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication,0
"with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources",1
"Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed",1
"Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes",1
"Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments",1
computers through internet made our access to information easier,0
"in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper",1
With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes,1
it is convenient,1
"you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world",1
"Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible",1
"via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities",1
"communication has become cheaper, faster and visual",0
computers have made life easier and more convenient,0
"it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways",0
There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home,0
"Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home",0
Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this,0
Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible,1
The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects,1
"Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit",1
Pressure is motivation,1
"Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job",1
The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers,1
doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily,1
the project cannot being done,1
The best condition might not be good for people,1
Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind,0
Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices,0
Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability,1
all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people,1
interaction help employees improve their communicational skills,1
they will have more and more friends and relationships,1
Interaction is a factor increasing working quality,1
technological progress causes corresponding problems,0
it still provides us with much more advantages,0
there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals,0
the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards,0
"Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity",1
"Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions",1
This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue,1
advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard,0
"With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control",1
we could get more happiness from technology,1
Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies,1
the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society,0
"People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions",1
This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment,1
"Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities",1
governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions,0
a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being,0
society should be educated and became aware of health issues,0
the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients,1
decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients,1
a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives,0
there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health,1
the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign,1
"zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding",0
zoos are very useful,0
in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities,0
This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos,1
"The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents",0
"When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity",1
"In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs",1
Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago,1
"Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities",1
Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school,0
"We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience",1
"If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have",1
"In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult",1
"It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies",1
it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous,1
a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals,0
Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve,1
"It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it",1
"This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs",1
In the present there is a lack of respect for animals,1
"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful",0
most serious movies have a wide variety of content,0
Entertaining movies are created to amuse people,1
most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical,1
"Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful",1
the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves,0
"""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses",1
"The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are",1
"Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness",1
it may point out the dark sides of the society,1
some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world,1
"""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict",1
"After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death",1
"Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality",1
serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way,0
I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives,0
media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society,0
disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages,0
paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem,0
media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people,0
The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip,1
journalism is changing,1
"Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people",1
sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems,0
"these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society",1
"yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues",1
"The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience",1
gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion,0
"The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story",1
it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported,1
a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour,0
museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place,0
it is easy to know the history of the new place,1
"Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York",1
"Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears",1
visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon,0
"Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us",1
"In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts",1
"To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown",1
a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit,0
"Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel",1
visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision,1
a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time,1
"if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums",0
it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place,0
I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom,0
distance education can't replace traditional school,0
Studying at home by using technology is convenient,0
The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day,1
you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course,1
You can study any time you want,1
"if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home",1
it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help,1
attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience,1
"when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements",1
Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects,0
Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision,0
"If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you",1
studying at home is very different from traditional learning,1
"Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates",1
there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates,0
We can learn a lot from programs at home,1
our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people,1
students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork,1
Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities,1
it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community,0
the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping,1
"Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose",1
it is one of the most productive malls in New York,1
"I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there",1
a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time,0
it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs,0
There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall,1
It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job,1
Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money,1
"it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand",0
There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers,1
"with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy",1
the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes,1
"I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community",0
stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress,0
"stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have",0
"if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems",0
"Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences",1
Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success,1
"it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals",1
stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization,0
"Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best",1
"other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems",1
"In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload",1
"some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches",1
"Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide",1
it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body,0
stress takes a toll on our health,1
This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress,1
"It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands",1
I myself agree with the plan to build the university,0
the benefit from it will outweigh the cost,0
I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community,0
"There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs",0
This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study,0
suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family,1
"If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university",1
He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university,1
a number vacant positions need to be filled,1
"the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc",1
there will be more opportunities to work in the community,1
This can also help stimulate the local economy,0
"when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services",1
building the university may lead to some social problems,0
A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university,1
"When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow",1
Traffic may worsen,1
More wastes have to be managed,1
Maybe crime rate will also increase,1
These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community,1
I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us,0
it has destroyed communication among friends and family,0
television has some good sides,0
they can be isolated from others,0
people watch television too much,1
"Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others",1
"Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying",1
children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents,0
"with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common",1
Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room,1
communication between family members is visibly destroyed,0
parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children,1
watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human,0
watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing,1
it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone,0
watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable,0
watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing,0
It can be unforgettable moments in your life,0
watching a live football game is an exceptional experience,0
attending a live football match is very fulfilling,0
"Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles",1
"As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting",1
"You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home",1
"Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored",1
"See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone",1
The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive,1
you will gain much more entertainment value from the game,1
You can cherish your experience for a long time,1
it can be an exclusive experience,1
"If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory",1
"You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie",1
"new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal",0
due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive,0
Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford,1
fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas,1
"it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms",1
the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming,1
these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think,0
utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly,1
Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards,1
the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams,1
This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds,1
the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations,1
renewable resources are not as reliable as we think,1
"contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming",0
these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions,1
we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain,1
These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy,1
With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable,1
there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon,0
"human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important",0
protecting endangered animals is necessary,0
"human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important",0
"land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society",1
"the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy",1
they produce plenty of profits,1
the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry,1
more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate,1
"the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important",0
"farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life",0
"farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live",1
"Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing",1
highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life,1
it can do good to protect the endangered animals,0
"farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals",1
agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy,1
we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals,1
we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct,1
physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day,0
"Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind",0
"including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age",0
Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier,0
"the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school",1
"exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues",1
Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function,0
It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better,1
"When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in",1
Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners,1
Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine,0
"Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice",1
they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life,1
"It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules",0
Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered,0
it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students,0
it can interfere with their life in various ways,0
many argue that it provide good working experience,0
Having jobs would affect the health of the student,0
It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life,0
for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies,0
"Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life",0
would affect their mental and physical health,0
"jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on",1
"This would result in stress, tension and tiredness",1
"They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep",1
"If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them",0
He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades,1
A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself,1
jobs can divert students from their studies,0
"If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money",1
They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money,1
"This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies",1
they drop out their studies so as to earn more money,1
"the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time",1
they should take advantage of life as much possible they can,0
"They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life",1
"He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others",1
"In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers",0
"recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity",0
zoos are fascinating places of entertainment,1
the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure,1
all zoos serve relates to education,1
Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world,1
some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct,1
humanities benefit so much from zoos,0
zoos just take away freedom of animals,0
"Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented",1
zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons,1
"I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way",0
I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity,0
"When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other",0
They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course,1
"when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it",1
such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group,1
Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying,0
"In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder",1
pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group,1
better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements,1
time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying,0
"Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time",1
"When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner",1
"I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying",0
we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment,0
we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible,0
Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals,0
many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them,0
Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals,0
"like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts",1
"When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts",1
"when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate",1
various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care,0
I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated,1
I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo,1
They beat them up,1
they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals,1
"If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one",0
my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture,1
Most of these lands are left without any treatment,1
The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land,0
This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land,0
"Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field",1
the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve,0
The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part,1
The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products,1
the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country,1
"The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms",1
Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs,0
showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money,1
a centre of business research is more important,0
we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field,1
"being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that",1
"My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment",0
One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about,0
learning by doing things develops our maturity,0
"When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself",1
You will not be in need to refer to books or persons,1
The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity,1
"if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation",1
We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading,1
learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about,0
There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them,1
Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing,1
People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming,1
Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming,1
we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things,1
"With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring",1
Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things,1
we become motivated to learn other things by doing them,0
learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things,0
there are good arguments in favour of this trend,0
cheap flight can make many serious problem,0
the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits,0
"cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group",0
"These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure",1
"They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds",1
"travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries",0
growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment,0
more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it,1
the biggest concern is the effect on global warming,1
Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up,1
"while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines",1
governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system,0
it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating,0
the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation,0
the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up,1
"Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource",1
"if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower",1
"this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline",1
public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems,0
public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars,1
"It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes",1
using public transportation is much safer than private transportation,1
"According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care",1
"there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting",0
spending money on improving public transportation is necessary,0
"it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in",0
human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet,0
"human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species",0
People are corrupting their ecosphere,0
"In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies",1
"These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage",1
"the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change",1
people are draining the Earth's natural resources,0
"These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity",1
"nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people",1
"Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted",1
"At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources",1
people are endangering other species' live,0
Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food,1
"Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct",1
"people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area",1
the living area of other species narrowed,1
This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction,1
human activity are gradually destroy the Earth,0
"it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives",0
supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest,0
I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest,0
conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history,0
supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually,0
conservation leads us to a higher standard of living,0
an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation,1
sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising,1
"Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society",1
"According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered",1
"rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries",1
"If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms",1
"the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will",1
art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings,1
"with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs",1
Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art,1
it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target,0
I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals,0
it is good to be lucky,1
depending on luck for everything is not good,0
I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does,0
"if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk",0
Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way,1
"If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment",1
"all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck",0
I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals,1
"if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal",1
those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination,0
They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal,1
"If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading",1
"a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery",1
He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery,1
up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened,1
"if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target",0
my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion,1
He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion,1
He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors,1
"he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply",1
At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship,1
he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity,1
students should be free not to attend classes,0
it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills,0
it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students,0
I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards,0
"some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook",0
This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic,1
By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching,1
they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently,1
being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life,0
Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning,1
With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency,1
"Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas",1
Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being,1
By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves,0
These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time,1
in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims,1
I would prefer to live in a small town,0
"I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities",0
I prefer to live in a small town,0
"it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town",0
In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities,1
on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities,1
people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress,1
the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items,1
One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town,1
in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic,1
Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness,1
in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits,1
it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities,0
another advantage of small towns is living costs,0
"Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities",1
in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes,1
because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services,1
Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic,1
we can save time and money,1
young people tend to study or work in urban areas,0
these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials,1
I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment,0
cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas,1
they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living,0
many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career,1
"if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time",1
cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation,0
the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities,1
it might put strain on the environment,1
"If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution",1
it will take some time on it,0
high school students should take a course on basic economics,0
it can provide students a sense of direction in academy,0
"Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss",1
That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation,1
students may study harder for their economic dreams,1
economy is always correlate with politics,1
"students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks",1
there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises,1
students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid,0
the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college,0
"They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students",1
That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible,1
I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary,0
it will yield more negative results than positive ones,0
it should be made available for a wide range of learners,0
"it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively",0
university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills,1
there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people,0
"Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones",1
outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage,0
"such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills",1
it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done,1
University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain,1
a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being,0
governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions,0
education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system,1
decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients,1
society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients,0
governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society,0
there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health,1
a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives,1
the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign,1
the capability of working independly is more significant,0
the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations,0
"in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help",1
effective cooperation can make things easier and faster,1
The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working,1
"Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares",1
"Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team",1
"if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own",0
the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people,0
Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas,1
"Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members",1
"When we work in team, we still think individually",1
our brain are not connected but separate,1
"When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective",1
It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health,1
"it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it",0
smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior,0
"smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it",0
"smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health",0
"the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself",1
smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned,0
it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health,1
"if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked",1
some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it,1
"it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health",1
"the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience",0
"The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals",1
"This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity",1
fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences,1
"Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation",1
most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior,1
This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity,1
the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader,1
smoking does no good to the smoker himself,0
Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits,0
it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies,0
it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work,0
"doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness",1
having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit,0
doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted,1
Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze,1
My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company,1
He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise,1
"When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight",1
He started to jog every morning,1
"After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend",1
having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind,0
doing something for a long time can be boring,1
"at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class",1
Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours,1
Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries,1
"we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured",0
"Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar",1
"When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves",1
It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence,1
the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable,0
the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways,0
we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents,0
investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work,0
"The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia",1
the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing,1
there are many accidents happening on the roads,1
"in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents",1
Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan,1
Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads,1
I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home,1
It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour,1
"if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions",1
spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality,0
All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes,1
Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried,1
We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents,1
a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities,1
"What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier",1
learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate,0
the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter,0
Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life,1
"And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not",1
"By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things",1
finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature,0
there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself,1
a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous,1
"If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely",1
family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time,1
You will grow to be dependent and reliant,1
free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose,1
growth is a long process that experience is indispensable,1
"experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice",0
These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent,0
I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly,0
"the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals",0
people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming,0
such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job,1
more people can sleep a bit later to go to work,1
they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts,1
"since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home",0
People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like,1
"More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before",1
This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases,0
parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice,0
parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person,0
parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life,0
"children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents",0
"As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents",1
Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that,1
parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind,1
parents train their child how to become a good person,0
They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way,1
it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person,1
children are shown how to behave well with others,1
this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world,1
parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life,0
parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children,1
they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children,1
"Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life",1
television has more positive effects than negative effects,0
the television can have violent programs,0
"if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects",1
I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children,0
it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children,1
television has useful and educational programs,0
"Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes",1
"If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it",1
"in Korea, there's program called EBS",1
It is targeted for children to teenager,1
We can study subjects through EBS lecture,1
there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea,1
Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects,1
Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses,0
Many children have a lot of stresses recently,1
they have so much pressure about study,1
"When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses",1
I got too much stress from the school,1
I was quite aggressive,1
"After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone",1
this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school,1
it helped me to relieve my stress,1
businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life,0
the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life,0
brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees,0
various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish,0
"The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas",1
the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge,1
the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards,1
"they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly",1
These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not,1
the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time,0
"At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary",1
they need to earn money to manage their life,1
the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons,1
Many people enjoy challenging them,1
they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones,1
The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed,1
this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise,1
the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue,0
the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment,1
It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living,1
the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas,1
childhood is the happiest period of one's life,0
"It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think",0
"during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to",0
Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult,1
"Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives",1
"We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave",1
Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community,1
childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most,0
"There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see",1
Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day,1
Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you,1
"Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination",1
"In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries",1
they are in no way free to think or use their imagination,1
Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child,0
"Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives",0
"It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults",0
life changes rapidly,0
"there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study",0
"the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today",0
past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times,0
"As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes",1
we can avoid making the same ones,1
"Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life",1
the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past,1
others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way,1
people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes,0
If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals,1
"By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them",1
"Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future",1
"the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions",0
"If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today",1
How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India,1
How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head,1
They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us,1
We cannot ignore them in any way,1
TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering,0
Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people,0
watching TV take a lot of your day,0
it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs,1
people like having meals while they are watching TV,0
Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends,0
my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights,1
It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema,1
TV can be one of communication ways,1
"TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps",1
Teenagers can play games online with their friends,1
we can communicate with each other through TV,0
TV helps you to get connected with people,0
TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends,0
it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation,0
it's one way of recent communications,0
it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life,0
it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money,0
"when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own",1
"At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book",1
I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend,1
"I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now",1
"when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents",1
"by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done",0
"if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him",1
"To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school",1
"Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work",1
"to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can",0
to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life,0
It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city,0
"I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons",0
"you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited",1
Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience,0
they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it,0
if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game,0
this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did,1
"My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day",1
"We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity",1
In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do,1
In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology,0
He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university,1
I have a friend that grew up in the countryside,1
parents are the best teacher,0
Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives,0
the things that parents say have great power to their child,0
More power than any friend or other adult could have,1
"if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong",1
a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people,1
their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else,0
They have more contact and more intimacy with their children,1
"even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves",1
"if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad",1
children usually mirror themselves on their parents,0
parents are the greatest teachers,0
ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives,0
But people should be careful with what they eat,0
some industrial foods are very bad for their health,1
they should buy only food from well known brands,1
being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome,0
they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen,1
people normally have lots of things to do,1
"if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch",1
"when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food",0
"if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions",1
Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time,1
universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars,0
now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability,0
many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities,1
"they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work",1
the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students,0
University is more likely to become a money making business,1
"In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission",1
"the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc",1
"it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies",1
"MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys",1
The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities,0
"universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education",0
a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students,0
a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university,0
he or she could push him/herself forward all the time,0
He or she should always keep the passion in her field,1
A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject,1
he or she can do better in teaching works,1
the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading,1
He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves,1
"All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher",1
"If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity",0
"As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers",1
we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted,1
a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time,0
He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions,1
That is good for both of the professor and students,1
"Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly",0
"They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on",1
all professors in the university are fortune of the society,1
"Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing",1
"Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth",1
in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways,0
"They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves",0
There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television,0
Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas,1
It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health,1
Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods,1
"In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases",1
"Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children",0
They communicate less with their parents,1
a lot of their time is used watching television and movies,1
"When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together",1
they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body,1
"When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly",1
These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images,0
"When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it",1
most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways,0
television and movies are entertaining,0
I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place,0
"it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places",0
"the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world",0
it's fun and educational,0
museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place,0
And also taking the chance for making friends,1
Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations,1
And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you,1
other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip,0
"My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums",1
a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression,0
"Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible",1
"I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers",1
"In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other",1
I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job,1
people will get respect from politeness within each other,0
Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need,1
A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure,1
There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed,1
"from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity",1
people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world,0
the society needs a civilized environment and orders,0
a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities,1
"In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners",1
"Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate",1
living environment is more important than job for most of us,0
job can bring us happiness,0
People can receive a sense of values and respected from job,1
"If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence",1
job can provide money to us,0
people should concern more about their living environment than job,0
"for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives",1
Few people can feel happiness from their job,1
they have to continue to work more than 30 years,1
"Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day",1
These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness,1
they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work,1
"beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people",0
"Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety",1
"Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly",1
Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil,1
"In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests",1
"In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick",1
these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people,1
local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories,1
they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job,1
most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases,1
it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work,0
the goal people is for good livers,0
television has more bad than good,0
it has made people not to have conversation each other,0
they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time,1
One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air,1
they think the programs are so crucial to their lives,1
"One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges""",1
"This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other",1
"watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us",1
television shows make people forget what is really important,0
it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness,1
Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone,1
it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together,1
It is natural they behave in that way,1
television shows don't require any participation,1
"even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television",0
"it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward",0
It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close,0
every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one,0
a hurried decision is almost never a good one,0
making quick decisions leads to probable bad results,0
"making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects",1
"if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision",1
making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity,0
"if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position",1
he wouldn't have been unemployed,1
"hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person",0
"To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs",1
his life had taken a turn to the worst,1
cars have improved modern life,0
cars cause a lot of pollution,0
"they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life",1
"Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car",0
they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle,1
Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances,0
my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city,1
I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away,1
Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today,1
Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship,1
"people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages",1
people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home,1
they are more flexible,1
My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money,1
"He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend",1
"If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms",1
cars increase the chance of employment,0
the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world,1
If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life,1
They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas,1
There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car,1
people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world,0
choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career,0
parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path,0
one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry,0
as parents are involved in the same environmen,1
"my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge",1
"Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting",1
he has many experiences,1
I could save enormous time in finding solution,1
This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues,1
"If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now",1
"they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information",0
they know which company has better welfare or provides better education,1
their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies,1
It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society,1
"When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process",1
parents have worked in tens of years,1
they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry,1
They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children,0
choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision,0
the condition of job market is completely different,1
"when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly",1
The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash,1
there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more,1
children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively,0
"children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily",1
Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents,0
"Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours",1
"I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes",1
"I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook",1
"I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying",1
Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad,1
they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity,1
"Recently, more and more children smoke",1
they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies,1
"according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies",1
there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health,0
sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children,1
it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching,1
children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation,0
"In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue",0
"children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies",0
they do deserve this high payment,0
those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways,0
a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career,1
They are not paid for no reason,1
"As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment",1
It's all the same in every profession,1
"the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods",1
such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances,0
Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves,1
They shall reap within their high salaries,1
"if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed",1
the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair,0
"as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair",1
"Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment",1
high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances,0
"It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy",0
people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working,0
"the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member",1
It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism,1
It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion,1
"the core of group working is ""consensus""",0
It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts,1
"In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement",1
Criticism definitely hurts,1
it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them,1
criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it,1
"Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism",0
taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you,1
Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved,1
"if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works",1
"As one Chinese idiom goes: ""The good medicine tastes bitter“",1
Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal,1
"even if you are right, criticism is still helpful",0
"in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work",1
Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all,1
You should have your own judgments too,1
And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism,1
criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism,0
the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school,0
using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning,0
it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own,0
"by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject",0
"Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class",1
"While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas",1
This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good,1
"I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore",1
"by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving",0
This will address students' interests,1
it's the assignment that needs real life participation,1
"in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them",1
"When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react",1
tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments,0
we will all perish as she's gone,1
"Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well",1
"Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain",1
All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one,1
environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments,0
"Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems",1
"Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together",1
"The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator",1
the rising sea water could drown them,1
Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality,1
all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth,1
the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues,0
"if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away",1
the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now,1
economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside,0
"It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages",1
environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence,0
students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is,0
"in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams",0
Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students,1
"Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements",1
students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes,0
It's an essential learning process,0
class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances,0
Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes,1
Many professors grade their students with class attendances,1
Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves,1
it's students' basic responsibility to attend class,1
this is a rather immodest way of thinking,1
professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors,1
"even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates",1
if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own,0
any great success need great work not great luck,0
luck is one factor in reaching goal,0
its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans,1
He do a lot of exercise in football field every day,1
it is not for which he is luckier than me,1
famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people,0
Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job,1
when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success,1
in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal,1
Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty,1
But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me,1
It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me,1
Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me,1
it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam,1
If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam,1
"You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky",1
you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question,1
we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful,0
"I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us",1
The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance,0
you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way,1
These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work,1
such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works,1
both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful,0
Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning,0
for practical subjects you have to have a teacher,0
sometimes I would rather learning on my own,0
both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages,0
it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own,0
I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused,0
A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier,1
"Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time",1
"In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her",1
And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time,1
"if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher",1
It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own,1
"if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly",1
There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor,0
"from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly",1
There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher,0
I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes,1
"In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite",1
I can utilize them as tutorials for many things,1

I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently,1
being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others,1
"As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game",1
Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive,1
Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example,1
The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors,1
It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers,1
It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value,1
being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others,0
"once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you",1
being different and unique is the better way to achieve success,0

the art and music should be required to study,0
"the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life",0
those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays,1
"It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures",1
learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures,1
students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played,1
art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful,0
"with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself",1
"Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life",1
"When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for",1
they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved,1
this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art,1
studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax,0
the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest,1
the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure,0
The education of art and music would not work if students resist it,1
younger students' art and music education should not take the second place,0
"in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure",0
every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation,0

The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them,1
young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually,0
this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation,0
They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want,1
It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them,1
They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences,1
having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success,0
"when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier",0

"Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank",1
"if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed",0
what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed,1
a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important,0
successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things,0
great success requires taking great risks,0
success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them,0
"if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places",1
By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities,1

These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books,0
There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things,1

some people make the television a priority,0
I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night,1
both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories,0
I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students,0
I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities,0
spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports,0
"my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory",1
"When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day",1
she is doing exercise without spending a cent,1
"What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health",1
The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students,0
students choose their major based on their interests,1
their major in completely involved in physical activities,1
for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories,1
it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field,1
"For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose",1
"when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people",1
spending money on social activities looks like wasting money,0
Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job,0
friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career,1
"Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions",1
"If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them",1
"no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue",1
make a good relationship with them,0
I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school,0
"if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss",0
"only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position",1
good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job,0
"Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job",1
majority of people would choose the former,1
it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future,1
it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions,0
"it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize",0
great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive,0
"Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term",1
"Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control",1
"This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else",1
"the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time",0
the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly,1
"If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent",1
those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired,1
Every employee can not afford this kind of loss,1
the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule,1
it is not need for young people to possess this ability,0
the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job,1
this ability is also essential for young people,1
young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability,1
"As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs",1
they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where,1
It is obviously a huge waste of time,1
"if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination",1
the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with,0
"In this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks",0
being present at classes seems a wiser option,0
being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college,0
they can help each other for learning materials better,1
if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems,1
"by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier",0
teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points,1
In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study,1
they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments,1
the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times,1
they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study,1
appearing in class makes students more conscientious,0
communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials,0
teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it,0
attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success,0
"I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal",0
Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier,0
"Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address",1
I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with,1
I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want,1
"It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country",1
Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents,1
"telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other",0
using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication,0
"sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment",1
"when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion",1
these types of communications make me feel personal,1
telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal,0
Telephones and email make me feel personal,0
I could directly connect with people that I love,1
I could express my personal thought through telephones and email,1
The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns,0
Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life,0
"the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture",1
I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside,0
People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends,0
"There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc",1
in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life,1
Better education results better career and been well paid,1
persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns,0
lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns,1
In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers,1
by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation,0
distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly,1
Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology,1
medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind,0
"living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services",0
you should focus on what you are good at,0
doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better,0
"the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be",1
"Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity",1
he hardly cared about something else,1

using two different soups properly was quite annoying,1
you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well,0
Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal,1
"When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it",1
you will motivate yourself to do more,1
I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school,1
I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably,1
I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems,1
I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems,1
"by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it",0
"If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it",1
children should learn to manage their own money at a young age,0
it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues,0
"sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne",1
when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked,1
First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished,1
"I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me",1
I found that I should manage the way that I spend money,1
I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted,1
"I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood",1
He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money,1
"His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless",1
"Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died",1
"Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family",1
"Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity",0
"If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs",1
children should be free to spend money to they what they want,0
it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons,0
our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood,0

studying many subjects is better that one,0
"students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future",0
learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject,0
it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future,0

Greenhouse effect causes of climate change,1
These impact on every living creature in the world,1
government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide,1
government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy,0
"If we lived in good environment, our life would be better",1
environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it,1
government should create campaign to fill love to family,0
setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other,1
"When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble",1
family is a root of society,1
"If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems",1
"When society had problems, it could impact to a nation",1
government should spend money on basic people needs,0
These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people,0
"reducing stress by listening to music, playing sports, and doing meditation are easy and practical ways",0
I always listen music from my mp3 player,1
I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me,1
I feel happy when I listen music,1
listening to music is a great way to relax,0
another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise,0
"after work, I always do exercise, and jogging is my favorite sport",1
"I feel that after working out, I am easily to fall asleep",1
Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health,1

"A way to do meditation is that I just sit down, close my eyes, and count my breath",1

"paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher",0
I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn,0
teacher could not pay attention to each students in class,0
learning abilities of student are different,0
there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get,0
there are certain period of time for teachers to teach,1
"In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class",1
Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule,0
"If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know",1
"main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time",1
teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get,0
learning abilities in each students is different,1
It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time,1
Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not,1
testing result are different,1
This problems depend on how hard study they do,1
It is not teachers fault,1
grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher,0
there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get,1
That is problem in quality of education,1
Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics,1
Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary,1
This problem should not be happened,1
"if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring",1
"if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper",0
"If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas",1
we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs,0
Then we will feel less interested in them,1
"But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story",1
Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl,1
"But now many people, including me, have been tired with it",1
I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again,1
"if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world",0
They will be misleading by those movies,1
they may act like good people in order to get reward,1
"Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person",1
the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not,1
we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding,1
"Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes",1
it happen more often in the real world than in those movies,1
those good endings sometimes are helpful,1
Some people may be encouraged to do good things,1
this kind of behavior won’t last long,1
someday they will realize the truth,1
we should show people the truth in the stories,0
"if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends",1
movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing,0
I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course,0
it should not replace classroom learning,0
Learning in classroom could provide more information to study,1
"learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation",1
in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example,1
"in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits",1
Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog,1
online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation,1
learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt,0
online class could not provide knowledge about social skills,0
This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes,1
"In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group",1
"This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group",1
in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body,1
Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way,1
"If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves",1
This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide,1
"learning in classroom, student could have healthier life",0
I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class,0
having classroom could provide abundant skills to students,0
classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject,1
classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill,1
classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health,1
Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think,0

these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life,1
There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way,0
"I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future",1
"in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step",1
Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem,1
I could adapt this method to use my real life,1
"When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination",1
Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time,1
I could find a better way to solve problems,1
studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems,0
This experience teach me to aware my health,1
Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself,0
reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy,1
I am always buy a quality food such as organic food,1
This food are not have chemical,1
I can have a good health,1
This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life,1
experiences are also change to plan for my future life,0
I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life,1
I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life,1
the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living,0
the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation,0
I’m facing the traffic congestion every day,0
people will have more ways to go to a place,1
now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community,1
It makes people in this area have no choice,1
They must take only a bus to go to another place,1
"If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them",1
people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule,1
On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus,1
this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly,0
"it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train",0
They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily,0
it is waste of time,1
the buses provide merely two routes in this community,1
It is absolutely a major problem,1
"if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus",1
having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars,1
The necessary energy will slowly be used up,0
people use less their own cars,1
"people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive",1
I personally prefer to work for a large company,0
I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one,0
"I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences",0
Large company equals more job opportunity,1
to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company,0
"Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries",1
"if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there",1
a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one,0
"The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success",1
this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees,1
common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company,1
"large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people",0
As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops,1
college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal,0
"Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future",0
Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have,0
studying in advance education take a huge of money,1
College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time,1
only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students,1
mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university,1
college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students,0
mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university,0
moderate students should have a chance to try,1
Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change,1
With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future,1
all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education,1
higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time,1
it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games,0
children should not be allowed to play computer games,0
playing computer games is a a waste of time,0
"An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days",1
"Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability",1
a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined,0
time on this activity is really time wasting,0
children could learn nothing from these computer games,1
all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children,1
"majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students",1
those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths,1
"It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar",1
"majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games",1
there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career,0
wok in person is preferred,0
this means help to achieve a good communication,0
discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails,0
team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently,1
An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity,1
"The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email",1
"the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one",1
The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other,1
there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members,1
Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official,1
people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing,1
"less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members",0
their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim,1
"if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed",1
work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project,1
emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none,0
sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place,1
"it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas",1
I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email,0
work in person will be more efficient,0
"we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience",0
professors should be encouraged to mainly do research,0
it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research,0
"While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society",0
"by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies",1
The research projects provide communication with the outside,1
doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors,1
Universities are relatively fenced environment,1
I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college,1
He was often invited to do speech in other universities,1
"my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects",1
The research projects like windows opened to the wider world,0
you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together,1
there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages,1
It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus,1
We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin,1
Universities positively contribute the professors' success,1
professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities,0
doing research could also improve the teaching quality,0
"With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom",1
They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice,1
I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project,1
"By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments",1
The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching,1
I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself,0
being without a teacher has shortcomings,0
"if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment",1
I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better,0
"for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising",1
"when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly",1
"professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study",1
They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages,1
"I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher",1
learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies,0
We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself,1
the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction,1
This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree,1
knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened,1
the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself,0
technologies allowed us to have a convenient life,0
it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above,0
technologies made our lives more complicated,0
it takes time for people to adapt them,1
we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day,1
many people often get lost,1
I use new Iphone which I personally think is great,1
"even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently",1
"I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up",1
I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn,1
new technologies are always great,0
they created their own language to communicate,1
people used computers or cellphones to chat with others,1
people try to type as fast as they are talking,1
they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language,1
"This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook",1
"What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions",1
my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of,1
I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative,1
technology destroys the language,0
online classes should never replace classroom learning,0
the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons,0
In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates,1
"if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better",1
"When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects",1
I got 1st rank in final exam,1
classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes,0
It makes you perfect in time management skills,0
in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time,1
you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others,1
"It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career",1
you learn quickly,0
"professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills",1
"You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts",1
"For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster",1
online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary,0
they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning,1
it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student,0
part time job will be good for students,0
it can destruct students from their study,0
i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result,1
"Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words",1
when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year,1
i had to manage my time efficiently,1
As i had to spend some of my time in my job,1
I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework,1
This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively,1
I learn money management,1
"When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop",1
"From this i learned, how to manage money correctly",1
"This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things",1
"students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job",0
"from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents",0
part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially,1
"By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it",1
after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents,1
its better that people learn foreign language in their own country,0
it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country,0
It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same,0
"In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge",1
"with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country",0
"in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc",1
it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language,0
it requires large amount of money and legal formalities,1
it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country,0
Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university,1
colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum,1
highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges,1
A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages,1
technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country,0
i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics,0
schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year,0
"it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule",1
Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers,0
several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low,0
students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation,0
Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure,1
"research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule",1
Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester,1
several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course,1
in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams,1
During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes,1
I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game,1
"During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter",1
saving some part of your earnings is essential,0
"you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams",0
they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence,1
They could not afford the rent,1
I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe,1
The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account,0
there are several uncertainties about your professional future,1
It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings,0
you can not be sure about the development in your personal life,1
Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car,1
He could not afford the maintenance,1
he had to sell it,1
Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished,0
with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams,1
I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend,1
Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream,1
there is no other choice than saving money for some time,0
it is very important to live life at a slower pace,0
living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages,0
"If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle",1
"Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome",1
their bodies cannot hold the pace,1
my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job,1
"After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine",1
living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health,0
If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's,1
If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends,1
living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness,0
Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level,1
a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it,1
he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships,1
"When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes",1
Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities,1
"you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience",0
quality takes time,1
I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade,1
I made few mistakes I could have avoided,1
"living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work",0
we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment,0
"we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions",0
If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet,1
"As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem",1
every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland,1
If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct,1
further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals,1
the natural diversity is very important for further generations,0
"Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming",1
"This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans",1
we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes,1
"recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average",1
This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate,1
a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather,0
"it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice",0
going to classes should be optional for the students,0
some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module,1
they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students,1
they have enough ability to read and understand the text book,0
the university students have grown up,1
"with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources",0
"from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently",1
some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way,0
"When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time",1
going to classes are sometimes waste of the time,0
It was waste of the time,1
"rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth",0
most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time,1
Students need to work as part time basis,1
"they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time",0
they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them,1
mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures,1
"if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks",0
few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures,0
some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time,1
"When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically",0
They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do,0
mass media deal too much with superficial things,0
"television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV",0
Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs,1
"Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world",1
mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience,1
television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership,0
"Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training",1
we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip,0
Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos,1
"there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother""",1
I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown,0
"In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful",0
Nowhere else can give me some people like in here,1
"In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun",1
"Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships",1
"If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible",0
We have large streets but few cars,1
we can move easily to anywhere,1
"Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends",1
The traffic in the city was too crowed,1
I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house,1
I love the traffic system in here,1
I want to live here,0
"I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town",1
There were a lot of people,1
the environment can't be keep clean,1
I also love the environment in here,0
staying in one place is better than moving number of places,0
Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences,0
"living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment",1
both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages,0
I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment,0
learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life,1
it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life,0
"students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club",1
Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates,1
"it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers",1
living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university,1
both living accommodation have its own benefits,0
living in dormitory is always helpful to students,0
"students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories",1
"They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills",1
"students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher",1
students also have a chance to know about the community around them,1
"Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation",1
living off campus prepares students for the real life,0
students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam,0
the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test,0
not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated,0
I don't like electronics,1
electronics cannot always be seen in the real world,1
the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject,0
And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics,1
But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics,1
"And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again",1
"Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach",1
And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics,1
"And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam",1
the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not,0
the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points,1
"if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated",0
"If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes",1
And the students will have nothing to do in the campus,1
he or she will play online games days and nights,1
The academic achievement will decline,1
this student will become a loser in the world,1
And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class,1
This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system,1
"Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors",0
The professors are essential,0
the schools are established for students,1
the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively,1
By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment,1
A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer,1
students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning,1
students have a better environment to working on their assignments,1
the quality of their assignments will improve,1
the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation,1
"In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby",1
I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment,1
It's unpleasant to stay at school,1
"coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly",1
the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors,0
"To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate",0
"the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better",1
High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money,1
There won't be any effect if school does so,1
There was news about raising professors' salary in my country,1
This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly,1
The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries,1
"if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen",1
I against providing more money to professors,0
Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university,0
pets should be treated like human beings,0
"they listen to us, more than some people will ever do",1
We can talk to them,1
"When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important",1
Talking to my friends was frustrating,1
none of them have ever felt that way,1
I was all alone at home for a long time,1
my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings,1
pets aren't able to speak with us,1
we can nonetheless count on them,1
pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are,0
"Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone",1
nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before,1
Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses,1
There are dogs who lead blind people around the city,1
pets are important for depressed people as well,1
without them they could not go around all alone,1
their presence make them feel better,1
there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs,1
pets are useful for a variety of things,0
pets deserve to be treated like family members,0
they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations,0
it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious,0
rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive,0
we need to catch up with the pace of the world,0
it might not be the most beneficial move to our society,0
fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world,0
"even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy",0
Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy,1
"If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline",1
it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless,1
It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it,1
it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times,1
with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work,1
We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace,1
when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made,1
This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start,1
"Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients",0
"other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality",1
A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars,1
"even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems",1
Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all,0
"in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic",1
I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones,0
living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world,0
"Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for",1
"For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns",1
"the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety",0
"Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns",0
big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does,0
"higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life",1
economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities,1
I prefer to live in a big city,0

they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk,1
No known scientist has success in first attempt,1
Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want,1
Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb,1
all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through,1
All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations,0
first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known,1
"I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them",1
"I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills",1
"When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me",1
"We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves",1
Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly,0
every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life,0
Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life,0
no additional payment should be charged on them,0
charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational,0
"""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers",0
charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction,0
"Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them",1
"Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so",1
traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban,1
it is out of drivers' control,1
"Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries",1
Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous,0
Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear,1
charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights,1
Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance,1
"Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways",1
"the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers",1
charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful,0
"Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil",0
parents should encourage students to take the part-time job,0
it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs,0
taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it,0
most people they contact with are also students,1
they can teach students many things about adult life,0
there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university,1
"when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults",1
"My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it",1
"Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life",1
"Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work",1
thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life,1
we do not experience it,1
it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be,1
we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be,0
"some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job",1
the part-time job can make people understand future life better,0
parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life,1
the part-time job will effect student' study,0
most students will do the part-time job in their holiday,1
it will not effect on their study,1
"Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday",1
type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone,0
my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper,0

"Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people",1
"I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding",1
These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time,1
About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game,1
"To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory",1
working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork,0

"could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay",1

I never have been rich in my life,0

no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers,0
"when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives",1
"As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating",1
parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life,0
we will never forget what our parents have taught us,0
we use it every day,1
I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me,1
"at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents",1
we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school,1
"when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life",1
"even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life",0
parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally,1
"my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice",1
parents are our best teachers,0
the same task give us opportunities to be an expert,0
different types of tasks endow more colors to our life,0
great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time,0
"when it comes to ""happier"", different type of jobs can be responsible factor",1
It allows us to achieve more,1

Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier,1
"consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits",1
They both will be happy,1

they can be familiar with their job,1
changing of job is what serve to their happier,1

"Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful",1
"Just like a song, if I did not have challenge, life would be blue",1
the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant,0
"there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job",0
we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment,0
the excellent knowledge will be of more importance,0
"it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded",0
"This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too",1
working alone is a longer-term job than communicating,1
the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave,1
the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job,0
the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker,1
"The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill",1

the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge,1

they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties,0
advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages,0
People benefit more from coming computers into their lives,0
computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier,1
by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced,1
"Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human",1
"Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early",1
"many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers",1
car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers,1
"Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished",1
A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers,0
Computers have opened up a network connection among people,1
This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message,1
Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers,1
People can use computers to extract their essential information easily,1
excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties,0
The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors,1
People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees,1
Computers have an important role in social and personal life,0
It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school,0
"Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries",0
children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education,0
"it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc",0
They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies,1
the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life,1
students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language,1
the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives,1
this time is the best time to learn any language,0
They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes,1
It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World,1
Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision,1
they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance,0
Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World,1
it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out,0
"it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life",0
sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to,0
in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations,0
"some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them",1
"In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity",1
after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country,1
Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences,0
life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks,1
"in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful",1
it is vital to never give up on your dream,0
"Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life",1
"One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down",1
many people are afraid to take risks and fail,1
It is possible to get frustrate along the way,1
"He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams",1
people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy,0
"there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live",0
"housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility",1
"I really don't like any of them, however I should do",1
"In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities",0
most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing,1
professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs,0
"I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field",1
"Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone",1
People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want,1
one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like,1
"After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month",1
doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment,0
young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time,0
living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income,0
Living on your own is a huge financial commitment,1
At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job,1
"It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself",1
Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life,1
Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents,1
"Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents",1
Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them,0
young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want,0
most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have,1
"It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs",1
"to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time",0
young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own,0
It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs,1
this development was a very positive one,0
the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable,0
Technology revolutionized the way we communicate,0
it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete,1
"nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever",1
"By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want",1
"in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places",1
they could easily get lost,1
This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive,1
Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends,0
"by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends",1
"According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet",1
"during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense",1
"by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully",1
the rate of divorces is increasing day by day,0
we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working,0
problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well,0
although using machines have many benefits,0
we cannot ignore its negative effects,0
"Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes",1
using machines can save company's money,1
"machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension",1
employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare,1
The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working,1
machines can bring many benefits,0
machines are more effective than human,1
"because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job",1
"Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability",1
using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation,1
nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing,1
they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware,1
"if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted",1
the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people,0
parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity',0
children may see that this behavior is inexcusable,0
celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace,1
Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively,1
too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions,0
"As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past",1
Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable,1
"This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests",1
Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols,1
this great invention causes many social problems,0
spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life,0
"as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends",1
distraction may be developed during study or social activities,1
continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children,1
"many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours",1
"In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again",1
"there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man""",1
the hardship of communication may be developed,0
"as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication",1
mobile phones have shortened the distance of communicatio,0
"With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet",1
mobile phones brings convenience of communication,0
they also contribute to some social problems,0
the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to,0
using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives,0
we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague,0
it is had some demerits on their social lives,0
they do not do much social live interactions with others,1
It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere,1
"some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts",0
"people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly",1
using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable,1
"there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time",0
they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had,1
people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life,0
"MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team",1
Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently,0
This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead,1
they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do,1
they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team,0
those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead,1
competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level,1
co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team,0
it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run,1
the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people,0
the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction,0
it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships,0
technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely,0
While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions,1
"Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient",1
"even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close",1
"technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends",1
technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network,1
"In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests",1
they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet,1
technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships,0
schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community,0
competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success,0
it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work,1
it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project,1
"A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system",0
a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently,1
it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others,1
"Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways",1
"Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team",1
"cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities",0
"in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself",1
"famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things",1
advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives,0
"some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits",1
not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement,1
all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods,0
most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell,1
"Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising",1
No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world,1
"online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing",1
advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers,0
"it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands",0
in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in,0
government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar,0
art price is about taste,0
the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector,1
the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent,1
a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production,1
"modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible",1
"Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me",1
He granted huge sums for such idea,1
Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work,0
the musician re-plays the song without any creation,1
"a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got",1
government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist,0
there is no certain parameter to value it,1
art value is about taste,1
labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day,1
"the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job",0
a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours,0
people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life,0
"I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies",0
"This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person",0
"By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick",1
they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons,1
The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life,1
"people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health",0
they usually remain busy in their office,1
they do not find leisure time for such social activities,1
I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years,1
"Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries",1
He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him,1
these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign,0
my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income,0
using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible,0
it is the essential in basic needs,0
A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself,1
Money is undeniably pivotal,1
ways of earning it is also various,1
"a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion",0
"Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable",1
"judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect",0
"the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered",1
Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century,1
his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind,1
the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark,1
"in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs",1
people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life,0
"buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements",0
"it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need",0
"for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising",1
there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it,1
"A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society",0
"products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought",1
the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy,0
sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption,1
buying habit is a very personal things for individuals,1
It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income,1
Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase,1
children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not,0
they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary,1
I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program,0
"students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics",0
these subject are necessary for students' future,1
when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification,1
the unemployment rate is always high,1
parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job,1
there are many things much more important than having a job,1
"studying music, art or sports is also very important to students",1
This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them,1
"to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation",1
"through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills",1
these subjects might fulfil the students' ability,0
"children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity",1
the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children,0
"the effects of learning music, sports are profound",0
newspapers and magazines will be history with the time,0
internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news,0
"when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident",1
The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth,1
"In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media",1
"Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two",1
digital media will rule over paper and magazines,0
A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis,1
This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly,1
one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War,1
It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at,1
internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details,1
"People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc",0
This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines,1
the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider,0
"considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years",0
the salary is very pivotal factor,0
there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard,0
I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators,0
"there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements",0
"People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary",1
in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well,0
"aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life",1
"career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary",0
"most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach",1
"people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries",1
"I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life",0
these people will not have an access to a good education,1
they can be proselytized into bad isms,1
most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people,1
"the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash",1
people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms,1
"children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery",0
they use it a lot of times,1
"wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child",0
"many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families",1
"people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life",0
children from rich families have better skills on how to use money,0
modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before,0
people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses,0
it is because of sedentary lifestlyle,0
sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems,0
The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology,1
they had more outdoor activities,1
"In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence",1
"Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools",1
people are experiencing serious medical problems,0
the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses,1
"Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses",1
"foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively",1
"life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others",1
the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale,0
there are some inevitable problems,0
they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken,1
"In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats",1
"Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels",1
tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment,0
"tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged",1
"Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment",1
"Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well",1
the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment,1
flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy,0
the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well,0
The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably,1
"With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing",1
"both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations",1
learning by watching TV suits some children,0
kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity,0
School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages,0
it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills,0
teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens,0
classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child,1
"Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively",1
it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes,1
students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this,1
"Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators",1
their knowledge and adaptability is priceless,1
a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries,1
such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career,1
watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it,0
"children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms",1
physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills,0
traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method,0
the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks,0
it helps working people to maintain work life balance,1
the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby,1
People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours,1
"For students too, studying from home is an attractive option",1
They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies,1
"the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious",0
"In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling",1
the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous,1
"once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues",1
This harms an employee's deliverable,1
Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly,1
These factors affect people who work or study from home,0
some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance,0
other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction,0
this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs,0
the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status,0
some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public,1
"some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention",1
"If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work",1
celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans,1
people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results,1
this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance,1
other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments,0
other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career,1
"Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation",1
"His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society",1
by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth,0
"If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study",0
"There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings",1
"Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs",1
"By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities",0
TV is one of the prime source of data and information,1
"they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain",1
"Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences",1
"Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades",1
watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health,0
if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children,0
demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits,0
it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company,0
workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects,0
"The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view",1
"The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity",1
most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability,1
old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm,0
"Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages",1
"Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace",1
knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly,0
their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life,0
that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology,1
"This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery",1
"Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment",1
using machines is advantageous,0
machines make work easy and smooth,0
The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat,0
there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy,1
the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans,0
machines decrease the work done by people,1
in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days,1
People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs,1
It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity,1
this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects,1
"The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes",1
using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome,0
usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work,1
Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens,1
city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas,0
Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options,1
"a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number",1
they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays,1
public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street,0
"Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles",1
huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities,1
The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people,0
"if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now",1
following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth,0
"when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way",0
This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual,0
Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age,1
"in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes",1
imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals,1
following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents,0
Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior,1
recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools,1
when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way,1
these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people,0
there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course,0
female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men,0
women can also do the men's works,1
The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently,1
the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people,0
"women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines",1
"These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities",1
giving equal education for both men and women is a must,0
"learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college",1
act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges,0
the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender,0
smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations,0
it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement,0
"Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely",1
"Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents",1
After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public,1
non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain,0
"further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health",1
smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems,1
introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing,0
the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings,0
tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact,0
"places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet",1
Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up,1
"It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents",1
"tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential",1
tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be,0
environmental damage is inevitable,1
"In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration",1
"a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild",1
"Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures",1
tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity,0
it is not tourism to be blamed for,1
future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense,0
there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life,0
its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern,0
"In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going",1
"Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment",1
the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict,1
staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative,1
IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves,0
"The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click",1
"rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh",0
"their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems",1
people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect,0
Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer,1
a vegetable diet can do good for our health,1
a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake,1
it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources,1
health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular,0
eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings,1
"Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life",1
people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals,0
it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind,0
"what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society",0
there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life,0
"They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention",0
the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life,0
"in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts",1
"the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed",1
"Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today",1
study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing,1
"a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress",0
the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect,0
"With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile",1
zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels,1
the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners,0
"it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand",1
the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable,0
"Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos",1
the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species,1
"Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory",1
the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection,0
"no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared",0
letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial,0
it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages,0
"we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive",1
educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them,1
some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese,1
"the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials",1
"in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only",0
saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money,0
the government should try to preserve minority languages,0
language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication,1
forming a language must be undergone thousands of years,1
it deserves to be respected and preserved,1
language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world,1
saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation,1
this plan should be put into practice,0
I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures,0
This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance,0
"Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones",1
they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle,1
"it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants",1
"No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness",0
"such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years",1
"if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance",1
it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases,0
it will yield more negative results than positive ones,1
it should be made available for a wide range of learners,0
university restriction has both pros and cons,0
"such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills",1
one deserves what he has done,1
outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage,0
University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain,1
"it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively",0
university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills,1
there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people,0
"Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones",1
the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects,0
teachers are the best for children's education,0
Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world,0
"to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge",1
"in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics",1
school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education,0
teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills,0
"after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills",1
parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way,1
it was impossible for them to be a good teacher,0
"compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children",1
Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work,1
there is only limited time for them to teach their children,1
there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job,0
income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers,0
"passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on",0
"people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably",1
"they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths",1
"people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication",0
money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs,1
"There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters",1
"important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated",1
some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies,1
"if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field",0
"While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion",0
"it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars",0
higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons,0
"Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries",0
"if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile",1
"for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities",1
"the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable",1
"people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis",0
taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation,1
"Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them",1
"America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil",1
"countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially",0
this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society,0
being armed with guns in the police force is necessary,0
it will bring the higher level of violence,0
a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one,0
we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself,1
criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs,1
citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally,1
"while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns",1
Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence,0
"people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson",1
police force carries guns only in high crime societies,1
technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization,0
We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life,0
"thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically",0
"Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities",1
applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives,1
technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process,0
exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously,1
technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements,0
"governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable",0
violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency,0
"reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate",1
governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs,1
"As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong",1
"by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes",1
it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies,0
adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day,1
"For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment",1
"Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them",1
"it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences",0
the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence,0
they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public,1
some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence,0
a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun,1
"An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him",1
police officers can force a criminal to surrender,1
the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries,1
Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably,1
"cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs",1
"Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance",1
there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities,0
people's health would therefore be affected negatively,0
life in those cities is good in some ways,0
life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health,0
"Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases",1
water pollution makes people's health become more critical,1
"dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time",1
Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before,0
Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market,1
"overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness",1
living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas,0
"Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder",1
it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink,0
"Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also",0
criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control,0
there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate,0
criminal mind seems to be more related to violence,0
if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease,0
fewer guns available mean less crime,1
this is not as simple as it sounds,1
stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime,0
most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally,1
"People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control",1
"if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes",0
the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself,1
"there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens",1
education is the single most important factor in the development of a country,0
education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country,0
"The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop",0
these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents,0
"In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school",1
There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities,1
They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands,1
"These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday",1
Basic education teaches one child to read and write,1
Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information,1
A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient,1
A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment,1
a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society,1
"the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country",0
celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously,0
people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation,0
it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills,0
They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them,1
the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles,1
people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people,0
"We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off",1
not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements,1
"only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters",0
"We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc",1
"to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates",1
this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society,0
mobile phones make our communication faster,0
it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health,0
"as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills",1
continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture,1
it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently,0
spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills,1
there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature,1
"In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors",1
frequent conflicts may occur during communication,1
the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development,0
"as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge",1
mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication,0
"Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience",1
both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment,0
"air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances",1
"solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems",0
individuals are unable to cope with these things,1
we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society,0
It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection,1
the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people,1
"the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens",1
"many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment",1
"it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment",0
"If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement",1
"the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment",0
children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting,0
"handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age",0
"this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing",1
It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well,1
"Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting",1
handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning,0
"This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities",1
poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance,0
kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons,1
It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works,1
the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills,1
"with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes",1
these taxes are absolutely essential,0
"by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor",0
many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course,1
"With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life",1
this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation,1
the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue,1
"the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care",1
the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital,0
taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in,0
such tax payments are unfair for them,0
it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use,1
we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade,1
We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes,1
both public services and arts worth investment,0
both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly,0
indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing,0
"Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level",1
"if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate",1
Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical,1
These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy,1
"The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance",1
our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts,0
"the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture",0
Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways,0
"The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries",1
these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones,1
"factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones",1
Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology,0
"Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets",0
technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways,0
Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world,1
"With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved",1
"Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces",1
this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children,0
media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere,0
This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living,0
The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard,1
they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted,1
"It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives",1
"without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living",0
not all celebrities are role models,1
"some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children",0
they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world,1
governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions,0
a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being,0
society should be educated and became aware of health issues,0
decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients,1
the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients,1
The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system,1
there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health,1
a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives,1
the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign,1
governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society,0
fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood,0
fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships,0
the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics,1
"in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child",1
The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage,0
"we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships",1
a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society,1
The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today,0
all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals,1
having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity,1
both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children,0
both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future,0
Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future,1
"children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company",1
If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary,1
when you always studying harder than others you will get best results,1
studying hard will give children a better future,0
there are many benefit when children doing sport,1
"children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player",1
It will be good for children,1
indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team,1
That will make children getting lots of friends,1
they can contribute positively to community,1
playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being,1
playing sports will give good effects on children,0
